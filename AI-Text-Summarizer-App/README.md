Text Summarization Application with Node.js, Replit, Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my latest project â€“ the Text Summarization Module! In this journey, I'll guide you through the exciting process of building a powerful and user-friendly text summarization application using Node.js, Replit, the Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman.


Skills Developed
Throughout this project, I honed several skills:

Full Stack Development: From designing the front end with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to implementing the back end with Node.js and Express, I gained hands-on experience in building a complete web application.

API Exploration: By experimenting with real-world APIs, particularly the Hugging Face Inference API, I deepened my understanding of how APIs work and their potential in enhancing applications with advanced features.

Postman Mastery: I became proficient in using Postman to explore APIs, test their functionalities, and generate code snippets for integration, streamlining the development process.


Tech Stack
Let me walk you through the tools and technologies I utilized for this project:

API Platform

Postman: A versatile platform for API development, testing, and collaboration.

Code Editor/Deployment Tool-
Replit: An all-in-one online coding platform that simplifies collaborative development and deployment.

Back End-
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.

Express: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, facilitating backend development.

Front End-
